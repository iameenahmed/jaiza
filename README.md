# Jaiza (Monthly Report Automation System)

## Overview

Jaiza (Monthly Report Automation System) is a web application designed to replace traditional paper-based monthly reports in educational institutions. This application streamlines the process of creating, submitting, and reviewing monthly reports by automating many of the repetitive tasks involved. Teachers can now manage their personal details and branch information with ease, while inspectors and supervisors can review reports efficiently, saving both time and effort.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Report Submission**: Teachers only need to update their monthly reports by adding the number of pages taught and the last topic covered.
- **Automated Test Management**: The system automatically calculates and manages the progress and test data.
- **Inspector Review**: Inspectors can review and approve reports before forwarding them to supervisors.
- **Supervisor Overview**: Supervisors get an aggregated view of all reports, allowing for better decision-making.
